{Vi does not have any of these commands}

VimGDB has been tested with GNU GDB 5.3, 6.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.1, 6.3 and 6.4.

The GDB interface only works when Vim is compiled with the |+gdb| feature.

==============================================================================
1. Introduction				*gdb-introduction*

Vim's gdb interface provides the following features:

* Input is done using the input-line window with syntax highlighting so that
  you can check GDB syntax while typing commands. Any GDB command can be
  mapped to a key sequence using Vim key mappings. This allows, for example,
  to set/clear a breakpoint or print a variable's value at the current cursor
  position by just hitting a key.

* GDB output goes to a Vim buffer displayed in the gdb window. This includes
  output done by the program you are debugging. The gdb window status line
  shows the target status.

* You can send an interrupt to GDB and the program it is running.

* A pool of assembly buffers holds the assembly code for the most recently
  used functions wether there is source code information for these functions
  or not. This feature can be disabled or interrupted.

* Breakpoints are highlighted in source code and in the assembly buffers. The
  highlighting includes the last two digits of the breakpoint number so that
  they can be easily identified. Disabled breakpoints are noted with a
  different highlighting color. VimGDB automatically finds the source file for
  the breakpoint if it exists, and displays and highlights the line. When
  there is no debugging information or source files, VimGDB disassembles the
  function containing the breakpoint and displays and highlights its line.

* Each time GDB displays a stack frame, VimGDB automatically finds the source
  file for that frame, displays and highlights the line. When there is no
  source code for the frame or when doing instruction stepping (stepi, nexti)
  the program counter line within an assembly window is highlighted.

* Depending on the GDB version you are using, VimGDB may run in two different
  modes: level 2 when using the deprecated GDB annotations level 2 and
  level 3 when using GDB/MI and the new annotations level 3. See |gdb-modes|.
  Mode selection is automatically done by VimGDB.

* Any variable (any expression in level 2 mode) can be "dropped" in the gdb
  variables window by selecting it and hitting <CTR-P>. The variable's value
  is updated and highlighted whenever changed. To remove a variable, just
  delete it from the gdb variables window with a Vim command. See
  |gdb-variables|.

* GDB command and file name completion. This also works while entering a GDB
  user-defined sequence of commands or a list of commands for a breakpoint.

* The current GDB session can be abandonned with the "quit" GDB command and
  another GDB session started later, within the same Vim session, using
  possibly a different GDB program.


==============================================================================
2. Starting VimGDB			*gdb-starting*

Before starting VimGDB, here are some optional Vim commands that you may want to
run or include in your .vimrc: >

    :syntax enable			" enable syntax highlighting
    :set previewheight=12		" set gdb window initial height
    :run macros/gdb_mappings.vim	" source key mappings listed in this
					" document
    :set asm=0				" don't show any assembly stuff
    :set gdbprg=gdb_invocation		" set GDB invocation string (default 'gdb')

Start VimGDB. There are two ways to do that:

1) Open the input-line window: >

    :call gdb("")
<
    and then start an instance of GDB by pressing <CR> inside the input-line
    window, or enter any GDB command in this window.

To open the input-line window, one can also also hit <Space> in Vim normal mode
when 'gdb_mappings.vim' has been sourced.

2) Start VimGDB directly without using the input-line window by using a
<Space> as argument to the function gdb(): >

    :call gdb(" ")
<
    or start GDB and execute straightaway a GDB command: >

    :call gdb("file foobar")
<
To stop GDB, type the GDB "quit" command in the input-line window. To start
another instance later, use the same procedure as described above, possibly
with another GDB program by setting Vim option 'gdbprg' to a different string.

The gdb program that is forked by VIM can have command line arguments, and
these arguments may be double quoted. These, as well as the name of the
program to run (must be in the PATH or start with a '/'), are set in the
gdb_invocation string of the Vim gdbprg variable. For example: >

    :set gdbprg=gdb\ --args\ foobar\ \"this\ is\ foobar\ argument\"


When $cdir (for compilation directory) is present in the 'directory' GDB
variable, vimgdb automatically locates the source file with the help of GDB, by
using the debugging information stored in the file that is being debugged.
This is very useful when the program to debug is the result of multiple
compilation units located in different directories.


					*gdb-modes*
VimGDB modes:
------------
VimGDB may run in two different modes called level 2 and level 3. Level 2 uses
GDB annotations level 2. Level 3 uses GDB/MI and annotations level 3. When
starting, VimGDB automatically selects the appropriate mode.

There are two reasons why you should be aware of the mode you are using. The
first is that the behaviour of |gdb-variables| is different, depending on the
mode. The second reason is that you may want to tell the mode that was being
used when sending VimGDB bug reports.

The mode VimGDB is currently using is shown on the first line displayed in the
gdb window after GDB starts. Another way to know which mode you are on, is to
run the GDB command "show annotate". The resulting "Annotation_level" has the
same value as VimGDB mode level.

The chosen mode depends on the GDB version you are running (technical: level 3
mode is chosen when the GDB command "interpreter-exec" that gives access to
GDB/MI is supported by GDB). GDB 5.3 runs with level 2 mode. GDB 6.0 and above,
and GDB 2003-03-03-cvs on Cygwin all run with level 3 mode.


==============================================================================
3. GDB commands 			*gdb-commands*

To enter a GDB command using the Vim command line, call the Vim gdb()
function. For example, when you want to set a breakpoint in Vim at
gdb_parse_output_cli() type: >

    :call gdb("rbreak gdb_parse_out*")

It might be easier to use the gdb input-line window and enter the GDB command
directly within this window. The gdb input-line window can be opened by typing: >

    :call gdb("")

or by hitting <Space> in Vim normal mode when 'gdb_mappings.vim' has been
sourced.

The following keys have a special function within the gdb input-line window:

	CTRL-Z	    send an interrupt to GDB

	<Tab>	    ask GDB for a completion

	<CR>	    send the line where the cursor is positionned as
		    a command to GDB. On an empty line, cause a new GDB
		    instance to be started if one is not already running

	CTRL-C CTRL-C standard Vim method for aborting a input-line window.
		    It also sends an interrupt to GDB

Of course using key mappings is even easier than the gdb input-line window.
See |gdb-mappings| for available mappings after sourcing 'gdb_mappings.vim'.

Note: As long as the current GDB command has not completed, VimGDB discards
further commands except interrupts and displays a message on the command line
warning that the command has been discarded.


==============================================================================
4. Gdb window 				*gdb-window*

You can hide the gdb window at any time with the Vim |:quit| command. The
gdb window pops up when:

    GDB outputs a frame (in other words: the debuggee stopped)

    the gdb() function is called

The gdb window initial height is set according to the 'previewheight' option
value.

The position of the gdb window on the screen at the left-right-top-bottom is setup
according to the values of the Vim options 'splitbelow' and 'splitright',
according to the following table:

			splitright          nosplitright

	splitbelow	    below		left

	nosplitbelow	    right	      top (the default)


In Normal mode, the gdb window is updated whenever GDB outputs some data. In
all the other Vim modes, VimGDB stops reading GDB's output.

All successive GDB sessions within the same Vim session share an unique buffer
displayed in the gdb window.

The gdb window status line displays the name of the symbol file and the target
status. When the debuggee is stopped, the target status is replaced by the
disassembled instruction of the program counter.


==============================================================================
5. The variables window			*gdb-variables*

The variables window and its related commands behave differently depending on
the mode being used. See |gdb-modes| for information on VimGDB modes. It is
worth upgrading to GDB 6.0 or later in order to run VimGDB with level 3, as
this level provides much better correctness in the display of variable values
(see below, sub-section "The level 3 mode").

The first part in this chapter discusses what is common to both modes.

The Vim option 'gdbvariables' (short name 'gdbvar', default value
"gdb-variables") defines the name of the buffer containing the GDB variables
that are displayed in the gdb variables window. This buffer is not related to
a file and belongs to the |special-buffers| category (buftype=nofile). When
this option is empty, the gdb variables window feature is disabled entirely.

					*gdb-cr* *gdb-createvar*
The "createvar" command is used with the variables window to drop any valid
GDB variable (GDB expression in level 2) in the gdb variables window. Valid
means the variable must be valid in the current frame. For example, to drop
the variable "*curwin" in the gdb variables window: >

    :call gdb("createvar *curwin")

It is even easier to select in Visual mode in some source code the variable
you want to drop, and just hit CTRL-P ('gdb_mappings.vim' must have been
sourced).

The "createvar" command can be entered as any GDB command but is not a GDB
command. In level 2 this command is mapped to the GDB "display" command so
that typing "createvar" and "display" are equivalent. In level 3 the
"createvar" command is intercepted by VimGDB and internally mapped to GDB/MI
commands.

The "createvar" command syntax is:

    createvar/FMT variable

where /FMT is optionnal and FMT may be one of:
    `t'
	Print as integer in binary. The letter `t' stands for "two"
    `d'
	Print as integer in signed decimal
    `x'
	Regard the bits of the value as an integer, and print in hexadecimal
    `o'
	Print as integer in octal

When dropping a variable into the gdb variables window, this window is popped
up if not already displayed: VimGDB picks up the first available window that
is not the gdb window and replaces its contents with the gdb variables window
buffer. It might be convenient sometimes to |:split| your windows before doing
the dropping.

In both modes, deleting a line in the variables window removes all the
corresponding references to the tracked variable in GDB and VimGDB.

Changed values are highlighted with the "Special" highlighting. With level 3,
when a variable goes out of scope, its value is highlighted with the "Comment"
highlighting.

The highlighting is done with the support of the gdbvar.vim syntax file. If
this file is missing or cannot be accessed by Vim, the equal sign that
separates variable from value in the gdb variables window are tagged with
(these signs are hidden when syntax is available): >

    ={=} for unchanged values
    ={*} for changed values
    ={-} for out of scope variables

The gdb variables window buffer is 'modifiable', which means you can move
around lines, insert empty lines and even add your own comments as long as
none of your lines starts with a number followed by a colon (more precisely:
does not match the regular expression "^\s*\d\+:")


The level 2 mode:
----------------
This sub-section describes what is specific to level 2.

The gdb variables window uses the GDB "automatic display" feature. In level 2
the "createvar" command is mapped to the GDB "display" command so that typing
"createvar" and "display" are equivalent.

Level 2 is not restricted to dropping only variables, expressions can be
dropped as well in the variables window.

The expression value is updated whenever the debuggee stops or the GDB
"display" or VimGDB "createvar" command is run without argument. Note that the
expression must be valid in the current context in order to be evaluated by
GDB "automatic display" feature. This is one of the important differences with
level 3. To make it easier to track data, each value is highlighted whenever
changed.

To "undisplay" an expression, just delete it from the gdb variables window.
VimGDB will invoke GDB "undisplay" command transparently to remove this item
from GDB "automatic display list" next time the debuggee stops or the GDB
"display" or VimGDB "createvar" command is run without argument.

Conversely, if you invoke the GDB "undisplay" command corresponding to a
displayed line, VimGDB will delete this line from the gdb variables window
next time the debuggee stops or the GDB "display" or VimGDB "createvar"
command is run without argument.

When The Vim option 'gdbvariables' is empty or the variables buffer has been
wiped out, the gdb variables window feature is disabled entirely for the
current GDB session and the GDB "display" commands output goes unprocessed to
the gdb window.


The level 3 mode:
----------------
This sub-section describes what is specific to level 3.

Level 3 deals only with variables, not expressions. However this mode provides
with the variables window a much more powerful tool than is provided by
level 2.

First, variables are updated any time you enter any GDB command. If you are
tracking variable "int foo" with a current value of 100, and run the GDB
command "print foo = 333", then its value will be highlighted in the variables
window and the new value displayed.

The variables that are out of scope are highlighted with the "Comment"
highlighting.

Variables that are in scope are updated and highlighted whenever changed.
Here is an example involving the scope concept: >


    typedef struct
    {
	int sample;
    } store_T;

    void foo(char *str, int *pnum, store_T *pt)
    {
	if (str != (char *)0 && *str != '\0')
	    *str = 'X';
	if (pnum != (int *)0)
	    *pnum += 1;
	if (pt != (store_T *)0)
	    pt->sample++;
    }

    void foobar(char *ptr)
    {
	store_T mainstore;
	int period = 200;

	/* Step 2 - "createvar" a variable for mainstore and for period */
	mainstore.sample = 100;
	foo(ptr, &period, &mainstore);
    }

    int main(int argc, char * argv[])
    {
	if (argc >= 1)
	    /* 
	     * Step 1 - Set a breakpoint here and "createvar" a variable
	     * for argv[0] after having split one window. From there,
	     * proceed by stepping line by line through the code */
	    foobar(argv[0]);
	return 0;
    }

Run VimGDB on this module and add variables to the variables window as
described in the module's comments step 1 and step 2. The variables argv[0],
period and mainstore are all in scope within functions foobar() and foo().
Their new values are displayed and highlighted as changed when changed in
foo() except mainstore that displays a value of {...} with the same
highlighting telling it has changed.

Trying to run the GDB "print" command on "period" while stopped in foo()
causes an error with the message 'No symbol "period" in current context'.
While in the same time, the variables window with GDB/MI is able to detect
changes in "period"'s value and to evaluate "period"'s value when stopped in
foo().

However, complex data such as structures cannot currently be evaluated by
VimGDB when not defined in the current context. Instead the following symbol
{...} is displayed and highlighted to tell you its value has changed. In this
case, to get the variable's value, go in the stack frame where this variable
is defined using the "up", "down" or "frame" GDB command and "print" it.

When exiting foobar(), period and mainstore become out of scope and are
highlighted with the "Comment" highlighting.

Note: The "createvar" command requires an argument in level 3. The "automatic
display list" and the variables are two independent features in level 3.


==============================================================================
6. Mappings 				*gdb-mappings*

The gdb() function accepts a string as single argument which is sent to GDB as
a GDB command. This can be used to map any command to a key sequence. Examples
of such mappings are given in 'macros/gdb_mappings.vim'. To use those
mappings, source the script: >

    :run macros/gdb_mappings.vim

The key <F7> is used to toggle between the 'gdb_mappings.vim' mappings and the
default Vim mappings.

List of key mappings in 'gdb_mappings.vim':

	<Space> launch the interactive gdb input-line window
	CTRL-Z  send an interrupt to GDB and the program it is running
	B	info breakpoints
	L	info locals
	A	info args
	S	step
	I	stepi
	CTRL-N	next: next source line, skipping all function calls
	X	nexti
	F	finish
	R	run
	Q	quit
	C	continue
	W	where
	CTRL-U	up: go up one frame
	CTRL-D	down: go down one frame
	CTRL-B	set a breakpoint on the line where the cursor is located
	CTRL-E	clear all breakpoints on the line where the cursor is located
	CTRL-P	Normal mode: print value of word under cursor
		Visual mode: GDB command "createvar" selected expression, see
		|gdb-variables|
	CTRL-X	print value of data referenced by word under cursor

CTRL-B and CTRL-E operate both on source code and on disassembled code in
assembly buffers.


==============================================================================
7. Options				*gdb-options*

						*'asm'*
'asm'                   number	(default 10)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+gdb|
			feature}
	Number of assembly buffers that are created at each VimGDB session,
        see |gdb-assembly|. The maximum hard limit to this option is 64.
        When the value of this option is 0 before starting VimGDB, the
        assembly feature is disabled. When it is set to 0 within a VimGDB
        session, the assembly feature is temporarily disabled.

						*'gdbprg'* *'gdp'*
'gdbprg' 'gdp'	        string (default "gdb")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+gdb|
			feature}
	The invocation string of the GDB program that is exec'd by VimGDB when
        starting. The first token is the GDB program (in the PATH or must
	start with '/') followed by command line options, possibly double
	quoted.

						*'gdbvariables'* *'gdbvar'*
'gdbvariables' 'gdbvar'	string	(default "gdb-variables")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+gdb|
			feature}
	Name of the variables window, see |gdb-variables|.
        When this option is empty, the variables window feature is disabled.


==============================================================================
8. Gdb assembly 			*gdb-assembly*

If you do not care for assembly display, skip this section and add this line
to your .vimrc: >

    :set asm=0

The Vim 'asm' option defines the size of the pool of assembly buffers. This
pool is used as a cache and holds the disassembled code of the most recently
used functions. These buffers are 'notlisted', use |:ls!| to list them.
Assembly buffers are cleared when you run the following GDB commands: file,
exec-file or core-file.

The size of the pool of assembly buffers is defined by the value of the 'asm'
option at the start of each new GDB session (default 10, max hard limit 64).
When 'asm' is zero at the start of a new GDB session, assembly buffers are not
used at all for the whole session. When 'asm' is set to zero in the middle of
a GDB session, assembly buffers are temporarily not used until you set back
'asm' to a non-zero value.

The assembly buffers are used:

a - when setting a breakpoint and there is no debugging information or source
    file, VimGDB disassembles the function containing the breakpoint and
    displays and highlights its line in an assembly buffer

b - when the debuggee stops in a portion of code where there is no source
    code, or when doing instruction stepping (stepi, nexti), an assembly
    buffer is displayed and the program counter line highlighted

c - when doing source code stepping (not stepi or nexti) within some source
    code and the corresponding assembly buffer is displayed simultaneously in
    another window, the assembly window scrolls to make the program counter
    line visible in the assembly code

When filling large assembly buffers, VimGDB displays a busy message. You can
interrupt the command at any time with a GDB interrupt CTRL-Z, except on
Cygwin.

Note: When the source is missing and the corresponding object is compiled with
'-g', GDB skips some frame annotations and therefore some $pc highlighting do
not occur. In this case, strip the debuggee with '--strip-debug' (or '-g':
remove debugging symbols only) to restore the normal behavior.


==============================================================================
9. Limitations				*gdb-limitations*

You cannot include |+gdb| in a Vim version compiled with "small" or "tiny"
features, "normal" features is the minimum requirement.

You cannot set any command line argument to GDB. However, all of them can be
set from within GDB with the GDB "set" command, once it is started.

To enable syntax highlighting in the gdb window, the prompt must be surrounded
by parenthesis.

VimGDB stops reading GDB output in all modes but normal mode, and in normal
mode when entering |zN<CR>| and |CTRL-\|.
