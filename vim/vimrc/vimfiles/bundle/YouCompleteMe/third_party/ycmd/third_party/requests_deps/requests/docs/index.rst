**Requests** is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
consumption.

.. note:: The use of **Python 3** is *highly* preferred over Python 2. Consider upgrading your applications and infrastructure if you find yourself *still* using Python 2 in production today. If you are using Python 3, congratulations â€”Â you are indeed a person of excellent taste.
  â€”*Kenneth Reitz*

-------------------

**Behold, the power of Requests**::

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    u'{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {u'private_gists': 419, u'total_private_repos': 77, ...}

See `similar code, sans Requests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.


**Requests** allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, thanks to `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_.
