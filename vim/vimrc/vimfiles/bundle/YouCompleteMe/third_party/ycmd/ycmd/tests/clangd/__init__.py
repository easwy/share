  Since LSP servers do not start until initialization we need to send a
  FileReadyToParse request prior to any other request we will make.

  |test| consists of two parts a 'request' to be made and an optional 'expect'
  to perform a check on server's response.
  Request part must contain either a 'content' or 'filepath' element which
  either contains or points to the source code that will be sent to the server.
  In addition to that, if |test| also contain a 'route' element, then a
  follow-up request will be made to the server, with the same file contents and
  response of that request will be returned.
  Expect part, if specified, must contain two elements named 'response' and
  'data' which are used to check status code and data of the result received
  from server before returning them to the caller.

    filepath = PathToTestFile( 'foo.cc' )
