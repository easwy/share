Community Sponsors
==================

**tl;dr**: Requests development is currently `funded by the Python community <https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3>`_, and
some wonderful organizations that utilize the software in their businesses.


-------------------


Requests is one of the most heavily‚Äìutilized Python packages in the world.

It is used by major corporations worldwide for all tasks, both small and large ‚Äî from writing one‚Äìoff scripts to orchestrating millions of dollars of critical infrastructure.

It's even embedded within pip, that tool that you use to install packages and deploy with every day!

After losing our primary open source maintainer (who was sponsored by a company to work on Requests, and other projects, full‚Äìtime), we are seeking community financial contributions towards the development of Requests 3.0.
