Requests has a great variety of powerful and useful third-party extensions.
This page provides an overview of some of the best of them.

Certifi CA Bundle
-----------------

`Certifi`_ is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for
validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the
identity of TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the Requests project.

CacheControl
------------

`CacheControl`_ is an extension that adds a full HTTP cache to Requests. This
makes your web requests substantially more efficient, and should be used
whenever you're making a lot of web requests.

Requests-Toolbelt
-----------------

`Requests-Toolbelt`_ is a collection of utilities that some users of Requests may desire,
but do not belong in Requests proper. This library is actively maintained
by members of the Requests core team, and reflects the functionality most
requested by users within the community.

Requests-Threads
----------------

`Requests-Threads` is a Requests session that returns the amazing Twisted's awaitable Deferreds instead of Response objects. This allows the use of ``async``/``await`` keyword usage on Python 3, or Twisted's style of programming, if desired.

.. _Requests-Threads: https://github.com/requests/requests-threads

Requests-OAuthlib
-----------------

`requests-oauthlib`_ makes it possible to do the OAuth dance from Requests
automatically. This is useful for the large number of websites that use OAuth
to provide authentication. It also provides a lot of tweaks that handle ways
that specific OAuth providers differ from the standard specifications.

Betamax
-------

`Betamax`_ records your HTTP interactions so the NSA does not have to.
A VCR imitation designed only for Python-Requests.
